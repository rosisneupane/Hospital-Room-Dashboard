Dear Rosis,

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing effort to improve efficiency, patient satisfaction, and resource planning in our Emergency Department, we are seeking your expertise in building an interactive data dashboard using Power BI.

We would like you to design a comprehensive **Emergency Ward Dashboard** that gives hospital administrators and department heads better visibility into patient visits, wait times, and overall performance.

### 🎯 Objectives:

- Analyze patient flow over time, identifying peak hours and busiest days.
- Track key performance indicators such as average wait time and satisfaction scores.
- Understand patient demographics such as age, gender, and race.
- Evaluate departmental performance in terms of wait time and referral handling.
- Allow users to search individual patient records for auditing or review purposes.

### ✅ Key Requirements:

Please include the following components in the dashboard:

1. **KPIs**:
   - Total Patient Visits
   - Average Wait Time
   - Average Patient Satisfaction Score
   - Month-over-month changes (%)

2. **Time-Based Trends**:
   - Patient visits by day of the week and time of day
   - Ability to filter by Year and Month

3. **Demographic Breakdown**:
   - Patient visits by Gender
   - Age Group distribution (Children, Adults, Seniors)
   - Satisfaction scores segmented by Race, Age Range, and Gender

4. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Average Wait Time by Department Referral
   - Identification of the Busiest Day and Time using DAX measures

5. **Patient Record Summary Page**:
   - A second page labeled **“Summary”** that lists detailed patient visit records.
   - Includes columns like Name, Date, Time, Gender, Department Referred, Wait Time, and Satisfaction Score.
   - Ability to **search or filter patients by name** using a slicer or search box.

6. **Design Elements**:
   - Clean and intuitive layout
   - Navigation between **“Dashboard”** and **“Summary”** pages
   - Visual hierarchy and consistent styling

### 📁 Data Provided:
- Emergency visit records including Date, Time, Gender, Age, Race, Name
- Department referral data
- Wait Time and Satisfaction scores

We would appreciate it if the final Power BI file could be delivered along with a brief walkthrough and documentation outlining the measures used, visuals, and insights uncovered.

Please reach out if you need any additional details or clarification.

Looking forward to your work!

Warm regards,  
**[Hospital Operations Manager]**
